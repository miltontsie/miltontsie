### Hi there, I'm Milton ðŸ‘‹

I recently made the switch to the world of coding, by joining the Full Stack Web Development Program of https://codaisseur.com/.
As a recent graduate, I'm looking forward to continue to create and expand my skillset. A showcase of my current abilities 
can be found in my EXPShare repository. This was my final graduation project for Codaisseur, and is a Fullstack website using technologies such as
React, Redux, MaterialUI , NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL, Sequelize and Socket.io.

The website is about sharing your experience with others, and includes features such as creating events and removing, updating your profile, search, and a live chat function
